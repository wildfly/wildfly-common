/**
 * A spin lock.  Such locks are designed to only be held for a <em>very</em> short time - for example, long enough to compare and
 * swap two fields.  The lock may degrade to yielding the thread after a certain number of spins if it is held for too long.
 * <p>
 * Spin locks do not support conditions, and they do not support timed waiting.  Normally only the uninterruptible {@code lock},
 * {@code tryLock}, and {@code unlock} methods should be used to control the lock.
